Use left and right arrows to rotate the vessel. Use 'up' arrow to thrust. Land safely to get more fuel. Don't let gravity crash you.

(Also works with W, A and S keys)

(Also works with numpad 4,8,6)

You can now pause the game with 'p'

If you purchase side thrusters then use q/e or numpad 7/9 to thrust left and right.
